# Seam-Carving-Algorithm

Seam Carving is a relatively new technique discovered for “content-aware image resizing” (Avidan & Sheridan, 2007). 
Traditional image resizing techniques involve either scaling, which results in distortion, or cropping, which results in a very limited field of vision.

Images are converted into a grid of gradients.
Using the gradient as a cost function, develop a dp algorithm to compute a lowest-cost seam for any given image.
